This is my attempt at the Project : Tic Tac Toe from the Ruby OOP Basics course.
I have to build a tic-tac-toe game played in the command line where two human
players can play against each other and the board is displayed in between turns.

- It must be made using OOP
  - How should every element be set up ? What should be a class? An instance variable ? A method ?
  - Information must not be shared more that it needs to between classes

Plan : 

- Do the program have an interface ? CLI
- What does it look like ? CLI
- What functionality will the interface have ? None, CLI, just naming spots on the board, displaying the board and the results

- What inputs will the program have ? text input just numbers from 1 to 9
- Will the user input data or will the input be gotten elsewhere ? user typed

- What is the desired output ? the player name put before the input ; the board displayed after a play ; the results announced after the game +/- a replay button.

- What are the steps needed to return the desired output ?
